# BevyEarth

An interactive 3D Earth visualization that tracks satellites in real-time.

## What is BevyEarth?

BevyEarth is an interactive 3D application that lets you explore Earth from space while tracking real satellites as they orbit our planet. Using live data from satellite tracking databases, you can watch thousands of satellites move in their actual orbits around a beautifully rendered Earth model.

## Features

- **Real-time Satellite Tracking**: Watch satellites move in their actual orbits using live TLE (Two-Line Element) data
- **Interactive 3D Earth**: Navigate around a detailed Earth model with realistic textures
- **Satellite Groups**: Browse and select different types of satellites (weather, communication, scientific, etc.)
- **City Visualization**: See major cities marked on the Earth's surface
- **Coverage Areas**: Visualize satellite coverage footprints
- **Time Controls**: Speed up or slow down time to see orbital patterns
- **Satellite Management**: Add, remove, and organize satellites in your view

## Getting Started

1. Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `cargo run` to start the application
4. Use mouse to navigate around Earth and the UI panel to manage satellites

## Controls

- **Mouse**: Rotate and zoom around Earth
- **UI Panel**: Select satellite groups, manage individual satellites, and control visualization options
